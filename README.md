## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices. We explore and compare different algorithms to find the best performing model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [source_name]. It contains [number] samples and [number] features including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   
3. Run the main script:
   bash
   python main.py
   

## Models
We have implemented and compared the following machine learning models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

## Results
We evaluate the models based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The best performing model was [model_name] with an R2 score of [score].
